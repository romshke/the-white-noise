### The White Noise

The gate creaked open like it hadn't been touched since the dawn of the last century. You stepped inside.

The mansion was silent. Too silent. Except for the steady drip of rain through a cracked ceiling. Your eyes ran over countless corners and door frames, scanning for danger signs. Nothing. At least, nothing a human sight could process through the dust with a little help from the dim light.

Moving forward into one of the huge rooms looking for a phone, you started hearing an unnerving static sound. A faint hum of an old TV in the corner. Turned on, but with seemingly faulty antenna, slightly touched with rust. On the table right next to it, a messy notebook with dozens of pages written in red ink.

...16, 23, -40, 1, -89...

It looked like some madman was trying to make the TV work by randomly tilting the wire, scrupulously writing down every movement in degrees. You felt a sudden urge to set it right. But there are hundreds of precise inputs in the notebook! It would be much easier to just calculate all movements with a simple program and make just one proper turn. You opened your handy laptop again.
